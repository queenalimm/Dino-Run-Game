<!-- HOW TO PLAY -->
## How To Play

Simply press the space bar and the dino will start running. Press the spacebar to jump over the obstacles (like cacti) in your path. The longer you hold the up arrow, the higher dino will jump.

The longer you play, the faster the dino runs/the ground moves. Once you crash into something, the game is over and you have to restart (your score resets, too). You can play again by hitting the R key.
